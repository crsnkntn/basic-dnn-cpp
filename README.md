# Deep Neural Network Written in C++

## Why I liked this project:
Coding this allowed me to have a deeper understanding of how neural networks work and demystified them.

## What is it
The dnn.h file contains code for a templated class that allows the user to implement a working neural network that takes an Input Token and outputs an Output Token of their choice.
